# CodeConversion

**CodeConversion** is an AI-powered web application that allows developers to **convert code between multiple programming languages** and **run code instantly** for select languages. Built with Django(Python) and JavaScript, and powered by the **Gemini API**, it offers a seamless interface for experimenting, testing, and migrating code across platforms.

## What is CodeConversion?

**CodeConversion** simplifies cross-language development by enabling:

- **Code conversion**: Translate code from one programming language to another using AI.
- **Code execution**: Instantly run and test your code in the browser (for supported languages).
- **Developer productivity**: Save time on syntax mapping, code rewriting, and debugging while working across tech stacks.
